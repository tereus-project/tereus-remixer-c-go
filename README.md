# Tereus C to Go remixer

Converts C to Go.

## Command-line usage

You can use the following command to convert a C file to Go:

```shell
go run cmd/cli/main.go <input.c>
```

## Worker usage

The remixer is designed to listen on a queue for C files to convert.

First, you need to copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the values.

The Kafka endpoint and S3 bucket should be shared with the [Tereus API](https://github.com/tereus-project/tereus-api).

You can then start the worker with:

```shell
âžœ  go run .
INFO[0000] Connecting to Kafka...
INFO[0000] Connecting to MinIO...
INFO[0000] Starting remix job listener...
DEBU[0006] Job '48549e3e-a181-49f5-b204-0fc56df3e319' started
DEBU[0006] Downloading job files...
DEBU[0006] Downloading file 'main.c'
DEBU[0006] Remixing file 'main.c'
DEBU[0006] Uploading file 'main.go'
DEBU[0007] Job '48549e3e-a181-49f5-b204-0fc56df3e319' completed
```

The worker will get remixing submissions from a queue and update the status and result in another one.
